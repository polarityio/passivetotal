# Polarity PassiveTotal Integration

![mode:on demand only](https://img.shields.io/badge/mode-on%20demand%20only-blue.svg)

> As whois lookups return data on nearly every domain, we recommend running this integration in "On-Demand" mode only.

The Polarity - PassiveTotal integration searches PassiveTotal for Whois information on domains and emails. For domains, the integration will additionally retrieve malware and open source intelligence in the details.
